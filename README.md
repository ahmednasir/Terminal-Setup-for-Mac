# Terminal-Setup-for-Mac
My custom terminal setup for MacBook

Install Homebrew. For that, run : 
```
  ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
You may need to install Command Line tool for X-Code before that.

```
  xcode-select --install
```

Install ZSH and oh-my-zsh : 

```
  brew install zsh
  
  sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

To run xsh shell, run: 
```
  zsh
```

To have additional features on ZSH, you need to edit the ```.zshrc``` file.

Check the .zshrc file to get the required features.
